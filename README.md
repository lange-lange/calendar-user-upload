# calendar-user-upload
Displays a calendar grid for the current month. When a users selects a day, a modal opens to upload an image. Images are converted to base64 strings and saved in a user's browser using LocalStorage linked by date. Reloading the page retains the images of a user's session. A baseline template was generated using Perplexity.AI. Enjoy!
